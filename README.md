TandemTable
-------------
A computer-assisted language learning system meant for co-located tandem language learners. Designed for a multi-touch tabletop, TandemTable is meant to inspire conversations and help them flow by suggesting topics of discussion and presenting learners with shared digital media artifacts that are dynamically downloaded from the web in real-time.
